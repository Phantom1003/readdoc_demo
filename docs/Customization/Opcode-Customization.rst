RISC-V Opcode Customization
===========================

RISC-V is designed to be highly modular and customizable, allowing designers to create custom processor implementations tailored to specific applications and requirements.
The modularity of RISC-V comes from its encoding scheme, which divides instructions into different groups and provides various optional extensions that can be added to the base ISA.
RISC-V provides a "reserved" opcode space, which allows you to create custom instructions.
